# Predicting-Apartment-Prices-in-Mexico-City
##A minimal Data Science Project.

```
What I learn from this project:
• How to create a linear regression model using the scikit-learn library.
• How to build a data pipeline for imputing missing values and encoding categorical features.
• How to improve model performance by reducing overfitting.
• How to create a dynamic dashboard for interacting with your completed model.
```
